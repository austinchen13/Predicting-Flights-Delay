# Predicting-Flights-Delay
This group project for DATASCI 261 at UC Berkeley focuses on predicting flight delays utilizing machine learning at scale techniques. 

My main responsibilities in the project were data exploration, engineering model features, and developing models using XGBoost and Random Forest in PySpark to predict flight delays.
